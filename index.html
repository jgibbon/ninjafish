<p><b>tl;dr: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/0qUFN">Screenshots</a></b>. This is an early Alpha Version which may and will stop functioning when you least expect it. In fact, I'm using this Project to get my Feet wet both with QML and with what I really want to do with my Ninja Block.
Not surprisingly, the current state of this is an interesting dish of "Tutorial Copypasta" with sprinkles of hastily thrown together glue code for good measure and some quick hacks. 
Pull-Requests or sample data from your Devices would certainly help out – if you've read until here, you actually might have both a Jolla and a Block and could make the difference. :)<br />
Here are some early Screenshots – the Layout may change:
