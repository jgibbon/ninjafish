Ninja Block RC for SailfishOS. 


This is an early Alpha Version. If you're not comfortable with building it yourself, you might be better off waiting for an official release. There's an even longer warning and some screenshots on http://jgibbon.github.io/ninjafish!

What is working:
 - Log in
 - Set actuators
 - Set rgb(8)-LEDs
 - Hide devices from main interface
 - Add actuators/LEDs as favourite

What is not:
 - Usable cover
 - Everything else
